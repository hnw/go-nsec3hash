nsec3hash(1) â€” generate NSEC3 hash
=================

## SYNOPSIS

```
nsec3hash <salt> <algorithm> <iterations> <domain>
```

or

```
nsec3hash <domain>
```

## DESCRIPTION

nsec3hash generates an NSEC3 hash based on a set of NSEC3 parameters. This can be used to check the validity of NSEC3 records in a signed zone.

## ARGUMENTS

<dl>
  <dt>salt</dt>
  <dd>The salt provided to the hash algorithm.</dd>

  <dt>algorithm</dt>
  <dd>A number indicating the hash algorithm. Currently the only supported hash algorithm for NSEC3 is SHA-1, which is indicated by the number 1; consequently "1" is the only useful value for this argument.</dd>

  <dt>iterations</dt>
  <dd>The number of additional times the hash should be performed.</dd>

  <dt>domain</dt>
  <dd>The domain name to be hashed.</dd>
</dl>

## EXAMPLE

``` shell
$ nsec3hash github.com

$ nsec3hash - 0 0 github.com

```
